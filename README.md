# Customer Churn Analysis â€“ EDA  

This project is part of a Data Analytics.  The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a bank customer churn dataset to uncover insights about customer behavior and the factors driving churn.  

---

## Project Overview  

- **Objective:** Identify key drivers of customer churn and provide actionable insights.  
- **Dataset:** `churn_modelling.csv` (10,000 rows, 14 columns).  
- **Target Variable:** `Exited`  
  - `1` = customer churned  
  - `0` = customer retained

## Data Cleaning  

- Dropped identifier columns: `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`.  
- Confirmed no missing values.  
- Dataset reduced to 11 predictive features + target.

## Exploratory Analysis  

**Categorical Insights:**  
- Geography: German customers churn the most.  
- Membership: Inactive members churn more.  
- Number of Products: 2 products = lowest churn; 3â€“4 products = highest churn.  
- Gender & Credit Card: Weak predictors.  

**Numerical Insights:**  
- Age: Older customers churn more often.  
- Balance: Higher balances linked to churn, zero balances often retained.  
- Tenure & Salary: Weak predictors.

## Key Drivers of Churn  

- Geography (Germany)  
- Membership Activity (inactive)  
- Number of Products (non-linear effect, 2 = safe zone)  
- Age (older customers at higher risk)  
- Balance (high balances linked with churn)  

---

## Recommendations  

- Target retention strategies for German customers, inactive members, and older high-balance clients.  
- Encourage customers to adopt **2 products** as it strongly reduces churn.  
- Investigate dissatisfaction among customers with 3+ products.  
- Focus onboarding and engagement in the first year to reduce early churn.
